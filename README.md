# Singapore-Resale-price-prediction

#### Technical Skills : Data Wrangling, EDA, Model Building, Model, Deployment
#### Domain: Real Estate

Scope:
The project will involve the following tasks:
1. Data Collection and Preprocessing: Collect a dataset of resale flat
transactions from the Singapore Housing and Development Board (HDB) for
the years 1990 to Till Date. Preprocess the data to clean and structure it for
machine learning.
2. Feature Engineering: Extract relevant features from the dataset, including
town, flat type, storey range, floor area, flat model, and lease commence
date. Create any additional features that may enhance prediction accuracy.
3. Model Selection and Training: Choose an appropriate machine learning
model for regression (e.g., linear regression, decision trees, or random
forests). Train the model on the historical data, using a portion of the
dataset for training.
4. Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model's predictive performance using
regression metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared
Error (MSE), or Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and R2 Score.
5. Streamlit Web Application: Develop a user-friendly web application using
Streamlit that allows users to input details of a flat (town, flat type, storey
range, etc.). Utilize the trained machine learning model to predict the resale
price based on user inputs.
6. Deployment on Render: Deploy the Streamlit application on the Render
platform to make it accessible to users over the internet.
7. Testing and Validation: Thoroughly test the deployed application to ensure it
functions correctly and provides accurate predictions.
